# Task Management API

This project is a simple Task Management API built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

The API allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task consists of an ID, title, description, and a completion status.

## Features
Create a Task: Add a new task with a title, description, and an optional completion status.
Read All Tasks: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
Read a Specific Task: Get the details of a single task by its unique identifier (UUID).
Update a Task: Modify an existing task's details by providing its UUID.
Delete a Task: Remove a task from the list by its UUID.
